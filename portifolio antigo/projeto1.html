                    <strong>Pac3 project was created by duo team</strong>, it objective was the final score for programming laboratory class.
                    We had to create or remake some game with <strong>python program language</strong>  using the pytest library and others 
                    frameworks and libraries, if needed or whished.

                    We decided to <strong>remake Pacman game</strong> , but we only made <strong>3 levels</strong> . the first easy,
                    the second medium and the last one hard. The game also <strong>have some tricks</strong> that the player
                    must find out to use, like the <strong>secret key for pass level</strong> that is a combination of two keys of the keyboard.

                    We made only using <strong>pytest library and the language python</strong>, specifically <strong>version 3.10.0</strong>
                     on <strong>pycharm IDE.</strong> We had to learn a lot of things in python from the begin to made work. 
                     With this project we learned the <strong>basics of python, functions, modularization, structures of projects, 
                        something about tests</strong>, had to work with <strong>git distributed version control</strong> and team work.

                    The <strong>greatest challenge</strong> was to make the "ghosts" work, called vilans in our game. The project doesn't look like we planed,
                     still have problems. But, was a big boost to our learning.
